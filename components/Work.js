        I enjoy working on projects that streamline processes or automate tasks and projects that teach me about new technologies. The majority of my efforts are often designed to generate or conserve money. Apart from a curios mindset, I also have a strong entrepreneurial component, and I enjoy developing projects that benefit me financially.
